In this project , I have build weekly scheduler app just like microsoft teams.

Tech Stack -> HTML,CSS,JS.

Functionality -> 
 1.User can click on any time zone and add their todo task.
 2. User have list of tasks from which they can drag and drop task to calender.

Future Scope ->
 1. We can extend this calender to full year or atleast for a month as its only limited to one week.
